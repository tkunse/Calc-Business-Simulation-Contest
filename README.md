Calculator for Business Simulation Contest in HSEFZ in July, 2017
=================================================================

I have taken part in the contest in July, 2017.
I find it so annoying to keep calculating all the data using the CASIO calculator, so I write this small but useful tool.
The only problem is that it calculates the real cost of production. It is much too low for the price you sell a product.
So, the improvements can still be applyed and only after a few more attempts can I find the best balance.

You can use Java to compile the project.
Recommended IDE: IntelliJ IDEA.
